# zip_app

The test app is to illustrate the pattern of provider + clean. As you may know, Clean is a really great pattern for code scalability and easy maintenance(Although it does require to write some extra codes).

This project took longer than expected to complete. The api is quite tricky, it is expected to have static types to return but it is not, brings a little bit difficulty to the test.

But overall, it is a fun test to do. Try some new things and seems working fine.
